##  :sparkles: Introduction
A visual prompting MLLM called EarthMarker is proposed in the  remote sensing (RS) domain for the first time. EarthMarker can comprehend RS imagery under visual and text joint prompts, and flexibly switch interpretation levels, including image, region, and point levels. More importantly, the proposed EarthMarker fills the gap in visual prompting MLLMs for RS, significantly catering to the fine-grained interpretation needs of RS imagery in real-world applications. EarthMarker is capable of various RS visual tasks including scene classification, referring object classification, captioning, and relationship analyses, which are beneficial to making informed decisions in real-world applications.
